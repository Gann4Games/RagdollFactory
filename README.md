# Ragdoll Factory
A tool to create ragdolls easily in Unity by clicking on the bones you want to have rigidbodies, joints and collisions.
You can build a complete ragdoll in under five minutes with this, useful if you use a lot of ragdolls and they also vary in shapes or anatomy.

## Installation
* Open Unity's Pakage Manager
* Add a new package from git url...
* Paste `https://github.com/Gann4Games/RagdollFactory.git` into the text field and begin using the tool.

## Usage
1. Once imported, select your model.
2. Look for `Gann4Games` -> `Tools` -> `RagdollFactory` in the menu bar.
3. Begin creating with your preferred workflow.

You can delete the component once you're done, and add it again whenever you want to continue working on the ragdoll.

All tabs have three modes: `Create`, `Edit` and `Delete`. You can change between them with the buttons found in the inspector.
